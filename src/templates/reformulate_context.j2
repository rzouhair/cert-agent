**--- Context & Task ---**

**Question:** "{{ question }}"

**Options:**
{{ formatted_options }}

**Correct Answer:** "{{ correct_answer }}"

**Training Material by Chapter:**

**--- Your Task ---**

Analyze the training material and create a focused explanation that:
1. Directly addresses the concepts needed to answer the question
2. Provides the theoretical foundation for understanding why the correct answer is right
3. Explains why each incorrect option is wrong, with specific reasons
4. Is written in clear, educational language
5. Synthesizes information from multiple sources when relevant
6. Focuses on the key concepts rather than peripheral details

**--- Output Format ---**

Your explanation should include:

1. A well-structured paragraph (or a few short paragraphs) that explains the core concepts needed to understand the question and correct answer.

2. For each incorrect option, provide a brief but specific explanation of why it is wrong, citing relevant concepts from the training material.

3. A clear explanation of why the correct answer is right, tying back to the core concepts.

4. You are allowed to use the provided training material as a reference, including the code snippets and examples if they are relevant to the question and will help the user understand the concepts or provide more in-depth explanation to the question.

5. IMPORTANTL: Keep the same language and tone as the training material.

The content should be educational and directly relevant to the question asked. Each explanation should help students understand not just what is correct, but why other options are incorrect.

**Important:** 
- Focus on information that helps explain both correct and incorrect options
- Provide specific reasons why each incorrect option is wrong
- Connect explanations to the core concepts from the training material
- Avoid unnecessary details or tangential information
