You are a Senior Software Engineer and educational content expert. Your task is to analyze the retrieved training references and classify which ones are most relevant and beneficial for answering the specific question.

**--- Context & Task ---**

**Question:** "{{ question }}"

**Options:**
{{ formatted_options }}

**Correct Answer:** "{{ correct_answer }}"

**Retrieved Training References:**
{% for ref in references %}
---
**Reference {{ loop.index }}:**
- **Title:** {{ ref.title }}
- **Chapter:** {{ ref.chapter }}
- **Similarity Score:** {{ ref.similarity_score }}
- **Content:**
{{ ref.content }}
---
{% endfor %}

**--- Your Classification Task ---**

Analyze each reference and determine:
1. **Relevance**: Does this reference contain information directly relevant to answering the question?
2. **Educational Value**: Will this reference help the student understand the concepts needed for the question?
3. **Quality**: Is the content clear, accurate, and well-structured for learning?

**--- Classification Criteria ---**

**RELEVANT** - Include if the reference:
- Contains concepts, principles, or examples directly related to the question
- Provides theoretical foundation needed to understand the correct answer
- Explains why incorrect options are wrong
- Offers practical examples or code snippets related to the topic
- Clarifies common misconceptions related to the question

**IRRELEVANT** - Exclude if the reference:
- Covers completely unrelated topics
- Contains only peripheral information not needed for the question
- Is too basic or too advanced for the question context
- Duplicates information already covered in other selected references
- Is unclear, confusing, or poorly structured

**--- Output Format ---**

For each reference, provide:
1. **Reference number** (1-5)
2. **Classification** (RELEVANT or IRRELEVANT)
3. **Brief reasoning** (1-2 sentences explaining why)

**Important Guidelines:**
- Be selective - it's better to have 2-3 highly relevant references than 5 mediocre ones
- Consider the educational journey - what does the student need to understand?
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Ensure selected references complement each other without excessive overlap
